May I introduce the person behind this repo. The dude
- knows some programming languages.
  - but knows nothing about digital circuits, analog circuits, or even "programming" itself.
  - even asks ChatGPT to write (code) for him (without markable success for the time being).
- comes from the pre-emoji era ðŸ˜½.
- is a plain, vanilla guy without special talents or magics.
- hates unreasonable deadlines.
- hates being disrupted or interuppted every other minute.

```python
if y0umu.observe_virtue(person.acts) in Virtue("é»ƒé‡‘ç²¾ç¥ž"):
    y0umu.show_respect()
    try:
        y0umu.learn_from_context()
    except:
        y0umu.feed_yoyoku(item=menu.rand())
    finally:
        y0umu.heal(target="self")
```
