May I introduce the person behind this repo. The dude
- knows some programming languages.
  - but knows nothing about digital circuits, analog circuits, or even "programming" itself.
  - even asks DeepSeek, Gemini, Qwen[0-9]+Coder, GLM and ChatGPT (the list would go on) to write (code) for him.
    - really get annoyed for LLMs not coping with the **latest** version of APIs.
- comes from the pre-emoji era 😽.
- is a plain, vanilla guy without special talents or magics.
- hates unreasonable deadlines.
- hates being disrupted or interuppted every other minute.

```python
if y0umu.observe_virtue(person.acts) in Virtue("黃金精神"):
    y0umu.show_respect()
    try:
        y0umu.learn_from_context()
    except:
        y0umu.feed_yoyoku(item=menu.rand())
    finally:
        y0umu.heal(target="self")
```
